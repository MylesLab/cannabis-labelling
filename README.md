# Cannabis project

This repository contains the code and data for the analysis of Cannabis samples for the manuscript titled "Cannabis labelling is associated with genetic variation in terpene synthase genes". This project involved the analysis of terpene and cannabinoid data from a previously published paper (Hazekamp et al. 2016) and a newly generated SNP dataset from Cannabis samples collected across the Netherlands.

The genetic data used in the genetic analysis can be found on DRYAD:

**Please note that the genetic data files generated in this study have chromosomes numbered based on the old numbering system. Within the 'cannabis GWAS' source code the chromosomes are renumbered for presentation in the Manhattan plots according to the new chromosome numbering system for the Cs10 reference genome that was adopted in 2020 (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_900626175.2>). All resulting figures from the GWAS follow the new numbering system, however, the raw genetic files still reflect the old numbering system and should be recoded if used by others in the future.**

**During the review process some chemical names from the Hazekamp et al. 2016 paper were renamed, these changes are recorded in Supplementary Table 3 and described within the methods of the manuscript.**
